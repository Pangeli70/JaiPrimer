# JaiPrimer

This is my personal primer for the language, and it is totally unrelated to Johnathan Blow and his company Thekla. 
It is based entirely on my own understanding and speculation of the videos published on twitch and youtube.
I was a programmer since when I was 15 and I have used several languages.
I have no direct experience in videogame professional industry.
