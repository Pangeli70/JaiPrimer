I have no association with Jon Blow. 
As of this writing there are no public compilers for Jai, so all information in this text is collated from his [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO). Therefore nothing in this post is official. There may be information more up to date than what is available on this page. That said, I believe everything in this post to be up to date as of this writing.

I have no association with Mr. Johnatan Blow and his company Thekla.

This is my small contribution to the Jay programming language, and it is based entirely on my understanding and speculation about the videos published on twitch and youtube. I was a part-time programmer since when I was 15 but I don't have any educational degree in information technology. I have used several languages like Basic, Delphi, C, C++, Delphi, VBA, C#, JS, Typescript and a very small amount of Python. I have no direct experience in videogame professional industry but I have used Unity for my job and to have some fun. I'm a fan of Mr. Blow, both for the games he made and for his vision about the coding art. I use to practice his approach of "designing by programming", and getting progress through tight cycles of small refinement after quick and dirty prototyping.
