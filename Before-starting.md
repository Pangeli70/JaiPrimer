# Good to know
Before starting to learn about Jai it is mandatory to have a good understanding of some concepts, acronyms, terms and coding methodologies. 
This language is not meant for totally inexperienced programmers. It is not a so-called "big agenda language" for everyone.
The learning curve without a rock-solid knowledge of software development could be very steep. 
So since this is a primer there is a brief and schematic list of terms collected in a reference [glossary](./glossary) that the creator of the language uses in his videos and that you can use to get further information before starting.
