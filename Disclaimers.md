Unless otherwise noted, at the time of the editing, everything described in these documents is/was implemented and is/was currently working on the prototype of the Jai compiler. As the latter is not yet released, everything in these documents is subject to change.

The content of these documents is meant to be updated by the [contributors](./contributors) and by the community of the followers of the programming language until the creator will, eventually and hopefully, release an official version. 

Especially if enough people "will bother him enough" (cit.). 

These documents are intended as a base to help contributors to write some IDE/editors plugins. These will be mandatory to help the coders that will use the language because using the Emacs editor as the author does, looks extremely painful. Especially if compared to the productivity tools available using C# with Visual Studio, or Typescript with Vs Code or Python with PyCharm.

These documents follow the same principle idea behind Jai: "experiment and try to get the things done quick-and-dirty". So there will be many drafted and missing parts, full of errors. Since this is a wiki instead of ranting, pulling requests, forking or branching, if you are interested please contribute!
